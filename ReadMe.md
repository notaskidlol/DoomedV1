        Why should i turn off Anti-Virus for some options:

         when excecuting an option sometimes windows detects it
         as a virus this is called a false-positive this basicly
         means that is gets detected as a virus but practicly isn't
         DoomedV1 is an open source tool so you can be sure that
         there is no hidden Virus or Malware inside of the program.
